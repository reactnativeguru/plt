# Pretty Little Thing Test

React Native
POC cart application

## Installation

POC requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ to run.

Install the dependencies and then ideally run app from Xcode

```sh
yarn
cd ios && pod install
or
cd ios && arch -x86_64 pod install (mac m1)
```

With more time better styling could have been implemented. More tests, Wish list functionality expanded upon, caching and all the other production features that required in a React Native app

1 test not passed will complete later
